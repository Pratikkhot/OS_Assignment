6. how to change the time stamp of file (man touch)
-->sunbeam@Pratik-s:~/Desktop/Sunbeam/OS/Assignments/OS$ touch File01.txt



7. Create directory structure : Give following commands ,
-> mkdir one
-> cd one
-> touch 1.txt 11.txt 111.txt
-> mkdir two
-> cd two
-> touch 2.txt 22.txt 222.txt
-> mkdir three
-> cd three
-> touch 3.txt 33.txt 333.txt
-> mkdir four
-> cd four
-> touch 4.txt 44.txt 444.txt
-> mkdir five
-> cd five
-> touch 5.txt 55.txt 555.txt
-> cd ~ (i.e. go to your home directory)

8. Considering above directory structure , Do following
operations :
i. list the directory contents of directory named
"five" from current directory (i.e. home directory).
1ii. write your name in a file named "44.txt" of
directory "four" from current directory.
iii. remove the file named "555.txt" from directory
"five" from current directory.
iv. change directory to five
one/two/three/four/five/ ).
( i.e. cd
v. write your course name in file named "3.txt" which
resides in directory "three" from current directory (i.e.
five).also read the same file.
vi. list the contents of directory "two" from current
directory (i.e. five).
vii. remove file named "222.txt" which belongs to
directory "two" from current directory (i.e. five)
viii. now change the directory to "one"
ix. remove all files only from directory named "five"
from current directory (i.e. one)
x. remove directory named "five" from current directory
(i.e. one)
xi. remove whole directory named "four" from current
directory (i.e. one)
xii. change to your home directory.
